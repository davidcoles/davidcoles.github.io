      <description>As a happy conclusion to the previous post, it seems that updating the version of Ubuntu to 24.04 resolved the outstanding issues.&#xA;When the hardware was initially commissioned 22.04 was the current LTS version, and I&amp;rsquo;m a little wary of using an LTS version which is only a month or two out of the gate, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t immediately switch.&#xA;As it became clear that were still some serious issues with the X710 cards which we were unable to fully mitigate then rebuilding the servers with Noble Numbat seemed like the only sensible choice.</description>

      <description>Recently we committed to using the vc5 load balancer (what I wrote) as part of the refresh of our edge infrastructure at work. We have been using it for some time for small, lower priority services, deployed on virtual machines rather than hardware. It speaks BGP to advertise healthy services to the network routers and works well, but VMs won&amp;rsquo;t scale to the demands of our main public facing services.</description>
